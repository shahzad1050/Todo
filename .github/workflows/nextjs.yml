# Workflow for building and checking a Next.js site
# This workflow is for validation only, as Next.js app with API routes
# should be deployed to platforms like Vercel, not GitHub Pages
#
# To deploy to Vercel, connect your GitHub repo to Vercel dashboard
# To deploy to other platforms, modify accordingly
